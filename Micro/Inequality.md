# Inequality
There is a trade off between efficiency and equity
## The Lorenz Curve
$\rightarrow$ Shows distribution of wealth
- The more bowed out the curve is, the more inequality there is
```desmos-graph
left=0; right=1;
bottom=0; top=1;
---
y=x
y=x^3
```
first graph is the equality line

### GINI coefficient
- Coefficient that shows wealth inequality
- 0 GINI means everyone is equal (equality line)
- 1 GINI means one person owns 100% of wealth
- Closer to 1 means less equality
