# Goods
> Rival
> The good can be used by more than one indivual

> Excludible
> The good can be stopped from being used

| --------- | Non-Excludible  |    Excludible    |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Non-Rival | Public Good     | Natural Monopoly |
| Rival     | Common Resource | Private          |

## Tragedy of the Commons
Since common resources are non-excludable but rival if there is a demand for them they will get over used

Examples:
- Over fishing 
- Deforestation
- Pollution
- Whaling
