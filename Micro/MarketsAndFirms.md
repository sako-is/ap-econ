# Competitive Markets

## Why do competitive markets work?
- You can go anywhere to make a deal

### Endogenous Variable
$\rightarrow$ A variable inside the model

### Exogenous Variable
$\rightarrow$ A variable outside the model

## Market vs Firm
#### Market
- AKA Industry
- Abstract idea
- Contains firms
- E.g. Market for phones, market for fruits, etc.
#### Firm
- Business selling products
- Can be in multiple markets

### Price and Quantity Graphs
$\rightarrow$ The Equlibrium Price of the Market is the Demand Line of the Firm
#### Market
```desmos-graph
left=0; right=10;
bottom=0; top=10;
---
y=x
y+x=10
```
#### Firm
```desmos-graph
left=0; right=20;
bottom=0; top=25;
---
y=(1/3)(x-3)^2+3
y=15
```
## Perfectly Competitive Market
- No barriers to entry
	- Restrictions/requirements that keep firms from entering and exiting the market
	- All markets have barriers to entry
	- Less barriers, more competitive
- There are many firms
	- More firms, more competitive
- Products in a market are *homogenous*
	- Identical/perfect substitutes
	- E.g. Table salt, gold, grains
- Firms are price takers
	- Prices are determined by the buyers and the sellers in the market
	- [[SupplyAndDemand]]
	- EQ Price is accepted by all firms
	- E.g. Gellato in Rome

### Short Run
#### Supply curve
$\rightarrow$ Perfectly elastic
- Since firms will only produce where ATC is minimized in long-run equilibrium the collectiv elong-run cost curves are all the minimum price

### Long Run

### Market Power
$\rightarrow$ The ability to influence the price of a product
- PC Firms don't have enough Market Power to change the price due to the abundance of Firms

### Labor Market
- The market consists of many firms and many substitutable workers
- Firms are wage takers
- There are no barriers to entry or exit
- Firms are **demanders** and households are **suppliers** [[CircularFlow]]
#### Demand
- The market's demand for labor is equal to all firms in the market's demand for labor
- The firm hires workers at a wage that does not exceed their marginal revenue product of labor [[FactorsOfProduction#Marginal Revenue Product of Labor]]
```desmos-graph
left=0; right=6;
bottom=0; top=6;
---
x+y=5
```
- If the curve comes from changes in $MP \cdot P$ the Labor demand curve will shift
	- $P$ - anything that changes the price of a product (i.e. shift in the product market) will shift the demand curve of labor
	- $MP$ - anything that changes the Marginal Product of Labor (e.g. new technology) will shift the demand curve of labor
- Demand for labor is derived from demand for the product it is used to produce
	- $P$ in $MP \cdot P$ [[FactorsOfProduction#Marginal Revenue Product of Labor]]

#### Supply
##### Things that shift the Labor Supply Curve
- Changes in taste (willingness to work)
- Changes in opportunity (substitute jubs)
- Changes in the amount of workers (immigration and emigration)

## Perfectly Competitive Firm
- One company that is part of a market for a good
- A PC *Market* is made up of *more than a few* PC Firms that produce the same good
- The PC firm's demand curve derives from the equilibrium price in the market
	- It is perfectly elastic because the firm sells all the goods at that one price
	- The firm has no power to change its price
- The revenue from each good sold is equal to the market price
- $MR = D = AR = P$ [[Revenue#Markets Perfectly Competitive Firms]]

### Short Run
$\rightarrow$ Firms can't enter or exit in the short-run due to the presence of fixed costs
- PC Firms can make profits or losses in the short-run
- If P > A**V**C $\rightarrow$ stay open
- If P < A**V**C $\rightarrow$ stay open

### Long Run
- If Price > ATC $\rightarrow$ Firms enter $\rightarrow$ Shifting Supply to the right
- If Price < ATC $\rightarrow$ Firms exit $\rightarrow$ Shifting Supply to the left

### Supply Curve
- The lowest the firm is willing to supply goods is at the cost of producing the good
- The Marginal Cost curve sets the firm's willingness to supply or the absolute least the firm is willing to charge
```desmos-graph
left=0; right=20;
bottom=0; top=25;
---
y=(1/3)(x-3)^2+3
y=15
```

### Labor
#### Wage
- The equilibrium wage in the PC Labor Market sets the wage for the PC Firm
	- Firms are wage takers
- The equilibrium wage = MFC = Supply for the firm [[Costs#Marginal Factor Cost]]
