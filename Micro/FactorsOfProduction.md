# Factors Of Productions
**Production = the process of creating goods and services**
**Factors of Production = the resources required to produce the goods that are demanded by consumers**

## LLC
**Land, Labor, Capital**
- Land = all resources which are scarce
- Labor = everyone with efforts, abilities, and skills. AKA Human Capital
- Capital = everything else like tools, equipment, and factories.

## PPF / PPC Graph
**Procution Posibilities frontier/curve**
- shows the tradeoff in the production of two goods
- the PPF shows the limitations of a country's factors of production (resources)
- PPF can be bowed out due to the gains from specialization
- the opporunity ost of moving from one point to another can be calculated using the PPF
- all points **on** the PPF are equally efficient
- bowed out curves are known as increasing cost models
- C (green point) $\rightarrow$ impossible based on the current resouces (possible via trade)
```desmos-graph
top = 1; bottom = 0;
left = 0; right = 1;
---
y=-x^2+1
C=(0.5, 0.8)
```
### Things that shift PPF
- Increase/decrease in technology and input used in production

## Labor
### Marginal Revenue Product of Labor
- MPL $\rightarrow$ Marginal Product of Labor
$MRP=MPL\cdot P$
