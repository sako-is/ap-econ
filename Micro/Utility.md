# Utility

## Marginal Utility
$\rightarrow$ The amount of satisfaction gained from the consumption of the NEXT good/service

## $\frac{Marginal\; Utility} {\$}$
$\rightarrow$ The additional amount of satisfaction gained from the next item consumed

- When comparing items you **MUST** compare them based on $\frac{MU}{\$}$
- as prices rise, consumers get less marginal utility per dollar

## Consumer assumptions
1. The consumer is rational
    - The consumer wants the most utility for their money
2. The consumer can rank goods
    - They rank goods in order of preference based on MU
3. Diminishing MU
    - At some point while consuming a good/service, each additional unit consumed yiels **less aditional utility** (marginal utility)
    - Almost always occurs after the first item is consumed
4. The consumer is constrained by prices and their income
    - **Budget constraint** - The limit on consumption placed by their income
    - Personal PPF
5. The consumer will always attempt to maximize total utility
