# Revenue

## Total Revenue
$\rightarrow$ Money flowing into a firm from sale of a given quantity

$TR=P \cdot Q$                                  \
E.g. $P = \$5, Q = 100, TR = \$500$

```
- In a shortage, the Quantity Supplied is used.
- In a surplus, the Quantity Demanded is used.
- At MSRP both are the same                     \
[[SupplyAndDemand]]

### Total Revenue Test
$\rightarrow$ Used to determine if a good is price elastic or inelastic [[Economics/Elasticity]]

- Compares changes in price to changes in revenue

## Marginal Revenue
- The change in Total Revenue from selling another unit
- $MR=\frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Output}$

## Average Revenue
- $AR=\frac{TR}{Q}=\frac{P \cdot Q}{Q}=P$

## [[MarketsAndFirms#Perfectly Competitive Firm]]
$$MR = D = AR = P$$
## Profit 
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Average Profit = Price - Average Total Cost
- Marginal Profit = MR - MC

y=(1/3)(x-3)^2+3
y=(1/10)(x-8)^2+11
y=15
x=9|dashed|y<15
y=11|x<9|red
y=15|x<9|red
x=9|11<y<15|red
```

### Profit Maximization Rule
$\rightarrow$ Profit is maximized where MR=MC
- If MR>MC then you should produce more
- If MC>MR then you  should produce less

### Accounting Profit
$\rightarrow$ The profit used by accountants
- Total Revenue - Total Explicit Costs = Accounting Profit

### Economic Profit
- Total Revenue - (Total Implicit Costs + Total Explicit Costs)
- Accounting Profit - Implicit Costs
