# Price Elasticity
$\rightarrow$ The measure of the responsiveness of the percent change in quantity demnded or the quantity supplied to changes in price\
**or**\
$\rightarrow$ How much more or less someone is going to buy/sell of something when prices change

## Necessity Goods
$\rightarrow$ A good for which consumption tends to show a little to no response to a change in price

## Luxury Goods
$\rightarrow$ A good for which consumption tends to show a significant response to a change in price

## Price Elasticity of Demand
 $\frac{\Delta \; \%Qd} {\Delta \; \%D}$

### Elastic
- A good is elastic if
    - Decrease in Price $\downarrow$, Increase in Quantity Demanded $\uparrow$, Increase in Total Revenue $\uparrow$ [[Revenue#Revenue#Total Revenue]]\
    ***or***
    - Increase in Price $\uparrow$, Decrease in Quantity Demanded $\downarrow$, Decrease in Total Revenue $\downarrow$

### Inelastic
- A good is inelastic if
    - Decrease in Price $\downarrow$, Increase in Quantity Demanded $\uparrow$, Decrease in Total Revenue $\downarrow$ [[Revenue#Revenue#Total Revenue]]\
    ***or***
    - Increase in Price $\uparrow$, Decrease in Quantity Demanded $\downarrow$, Increase in Total Revenue $\uparrow$

### Unit Elastic
- A good is unit elastic if
    - Decrease in Price $\downarrow$, Increase in Quantity Demanded $\uparrow$, No change in Total Revenue $\leftrightarrow$ [[Revenue#Revenue#Total Revenue]]\
    ***or***
    - Increase in Price $\uparrow$, Decrease in Quantity Demanded $\downarrow$, No change in Total Revenue $\leftrightarrow$

## Cross Price Elasticity of Demand
$\frac{\Delta \; \%Qd_a} {\Delta \; \%P_b}$

$\rightarrow$ To determine if two goods are substitutes or complements and the strength of that relationship

- **Positive** = Substitute
- **Negative** = Complement

## Income Elasticity of Demand
$\frac{\Delta \; \%Qd} {\Delta \; \%I}$, where $I=Income$

$\rightarrow$ To determine if a good is inferior or normal and the strength of that relationship

- **Positive** = Normal
- **Negative** = Inferior
